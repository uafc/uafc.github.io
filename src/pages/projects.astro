In this project, mentees will first begin to learn the basics of Python programming such as data types and basic syntax. They will practice this new found knowledge in examples of simple programs designed to help them learn how to use these data types and structures. The main part of this project will be the Pong game that they make using Python's Turtle module. Here, mentees will familiarize themselves with creating programs and have the chance to create a small game that they can play with a friend. This project will be taught with Object Oriented Programming design principles in mind, to give mentees a small but in depth introduction into the exciting world of programming."></Project_Card>

      <!-- Django Messaging Website -->
      <Project_Card title="Django Messaging Website", my_img="/django_image.jpg", alt_name = "Django Messaging Website", body="In the Django Messaging Website Project, we will be creating a custom chat app using the Django Web frame. The application will allow the user to set up a local chat room and send messages between two browsers. This project will begin with an overview of the basics of the Python programming language.

      <!-- Robotic Arm -->
      <Project_Card title="Robotic Arm", my_img="/Robots-are-taking-over.jpeg", alt_name = "Robotic Arm", body="In the Robotic Arm Project, we create an interactive mechanical arm with 3 axis of rotation to lift and move items around. We learn the fundamentals of programming in C/C++ using the Arduino IDE to code desired movement with servo motors, based on keyboard input, and how to wire/connect the motors to the Arduino board. To design the arm, we will introduce basic CAD techniques to visualize prototypes with proper scaling."></Project_Card>

      <!-- Ultrasonic Sensor Catapult -->
      <Project_Card title="Ultrasonic Sensor Catapult", my_img="/unsplash-image-eybM9n4yrpE.jpg", alt_name = "Ultrasonic Sensor Catapult", body="In the Ultrasonic Sensor Catapult project, we combine Arduino coding and hardware. We build a catapult and launch a projectile at an object detected within range. Using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino, including the integration of both visual and auditory signals, an object within range is identified and targeted. This ultimately enables the catapult arm to rise, rotate and release a projectile."></Project_Card>

      <!-- Weather Station -->
      <Project_Card title="Weather Station", my_img="/unsplash-image-zWUTXNNwU3A.jpg", alt_name = "Weather Station", body="In this project we combine Arduino software and hardware to create a weather station. Beginning with an introduction to Arduino coding, we’ll then start breadboarding, wiring and learning the basics of printing messages to a LCD (liquid crystal display). We will finish with utilizing sensors, resistors, receivers and transmitters, as well as integrating the LCD into our circuit. By the end of the project you’ll have a weather station that displays temperatures, heat index and humidity."></Project_Card>

      <!-- Solar Charger -->
      <Project_Card title="Solar Charger", my_img="/unsplash-image-hxUcl0nUsIY.jpg", alt_name = "Solar Charger", body="This project lights up a LED bulb using solar panels for power. It uses two photoresistors and a code that controls a servo motor to move the solar panels to gather as much light as possible. With the code, photoresistors, and motor, maximum energy is used to power the light bulb! On top of the coding, the project also features electrical wiring!"></Project_Card>
